# Foundation

LAI Claude Code Config orchestrates AI agents as trusted engineering collaborators on complex codebases. It enforces a structured session-based workflow (spec → plan → build → docs) with full traceability, enabling experienced developers to leverage AI effectively while maintaining institutional knowledge through self-updating documentation.

This is the intent layer — why we build, how we decide, and what we won't do.

## Contents

### [10-purpose.md](10-purpose.md)
Why this system exists, the problem it solves, and who it serves.

### [20-principles.md](20-principles.md)
Decision-making heuristics that apply across all code and documentation.

### [30-boundaries.md](30-boundaries.md)
What this system explicitly will not do, and constraints we accept.

## How to Use Foundation

Read Foundation before diving into the Codebase. These documents prime your understanding of:
- **Why** the system exists (Purpose)
- **How** decisions should be made (Principles)
- **What** is out of scope (Boundaries)

This context ensures changes align with the system's intent, not just its current implementation.
