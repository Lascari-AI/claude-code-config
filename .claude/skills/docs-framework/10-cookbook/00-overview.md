# Cookbook

Intent-based entry points for documentation tasks. Each cookbook orchestrates the appropriate workflows based on what you need to accomplish.

## The Three Intents

| Intent | When to Use | Cookbook |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Navigate** | Research, understand codebase, find where X is handled | [10-navigate.md](10-navigate.md) |
| **Produce** | New feature, new component, significant addition | [20-produce.md](20-produce.md) |
| **Maintain** | Chore, bug fix, refactor, alignment check | [30-maintain.md](30-maintain.md) |

## Intent Detection

**Navigate** — You're trying to understand something:
- "How does X work?"
- "Where is Y handled?"
- "What's the architecture of Z?"
- Research tasks, exploration, context-gathering

**Produce** — You're creating something new:
- "Add a new feature for..."
- "Implement a new component..."
- "Create documentation for..."
- New functionality that needs new docs

**Maintain** — You're updating something existing:
- "Fix the bug in..."
- "Refactor the..."
- "Update the docs to reflect..."
- Changes to existing code that may drift from docs
