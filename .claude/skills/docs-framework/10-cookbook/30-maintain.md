# Maintain: Keeping Docs Aligned

When making changes to existing code—bug fixes, refactors, chores—documentation may drift from reality. The maintain workflow updates documentation to match.

---

## When to Use

- Bug fixes that change behavior
- Refactoring that restructures code
- Chores and minor updates
- Periodic health checks
- Before major releases

---

## The Maintenance Workflow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    Write    │ ──▶ │   Audit     │
│  (update)   │     │  (verify)   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Write (Update Docs)

**Purpose:** Update documentation to match current code using implementation notes.

**Load:** `../30-workflows/50-write.md`

**Input:** Provide notes describing what changed:
- Implementation notes from the work you just completed
- A summary of the refactor or bug fix
- Description of new functionality added

**Process:**
- Reads existing docs and source code
- Shows what will be created/updated
- Writes the documentation changes

**Output:** Updated L2/L3 documentation aligned with current code.

### Step 2: Audit (Verify Health)

**Purpose:** Validate documentation structure, frontmatter, and overall health.

**Load:** `../30-workflows/70-audit.md`

**Checks:**
- Frontmatter schema compliance
- Required fields present
- Numbering system followed
- Cross-references valid
- No orphaned docs

**Output:** Health report with pass/fail per check.

## Maintenance Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| After code change | Write with implementation notes |
| After refactor | Write on refactored section |
| Weekly/sprint boundary | Audit on active sections |
| Before release | Full audit on entire `docs/` |

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | Workflow |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/docs:write <path> [notes]` | Update docs from notes | `30-workflows/50-write.md` |
| `/docs:audit [quick\|deep]` | Validate structure and health | `30-workflows/80-audit.md` |

---

## Quick vs Deep Audit

| Mode | Scope | Checks |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Quick** | Single section | Frontmatter, structure |
| **Deep** | Full `docs/` | Everything + cross-refs |

---

## Drift Prevention

To minimize maintenance burden:

1. **Document as you code** — Don't accumulate debt
2. **Write notes as you implement** — Capture context while fresh
3. **Include docs in review** — Make docs part of "done"
4. **Automate audits** — CI check for frontmatter schema

---

## Common Drift Patterns

| Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Renamed function** | Docstring references old name | Update L5 docstring |
| **Moved file** | Code ref points to old path | Update `code-ref` in L3 |
| **Deleted feature** | Doc exists for removed code | Remove orphaned doc |
| **New parameter** | Docstring missing param | Update L5 docstring |
| **Changed behavior** | Doc describes old behavior | Revise L3/L4 description |
