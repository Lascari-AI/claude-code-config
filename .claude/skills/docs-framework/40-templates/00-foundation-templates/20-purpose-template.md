# Purpose Template

Template for `docs/00-foundation/10-purpose.md`. Defines why the system exists, who it serves, and what success looks like.

---

## Template

```markdown
---
covers: Why this system exists, the problem it solves, and who it serves.
concepts: [purpose, problem, users]
---

# Purpose

[One sentence stating the core purpose. What problem does this solve and for whom?]

---

## The Problem We Solve

[What problem does this system address? Who experiences this problem? Why does it matter?]

## Who We Serve

[Primary users or beneficiaries. What do they need? What are their constraints?]

## Why This Approach

[Why did we build it this way instead of alternatives? What trade-offs did we make?]

## Success Looks Like

[How do we know we're achieving our purpose? What outcomes indicate success?]
```

## Guidance

### The Problem We Solve
Be specific about the pain point. "Developers waste time searching for existing code" is better than "improve developer productivity."

### Who We Serve
Name concrete user types. "Solo knowledge workers who need to capture tasks without breaking flow" is better than "users who want to be productive."

### Why This Approach
Explain the key trade-offs. If you chose speed over features, say so. This helps future decisions stay aligned.

### Success Looks Like
Observable outcomes, not metrics. "Users find existing services instead of duplicating them" is better than "reduce code duplication by 50%."
