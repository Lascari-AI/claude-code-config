    {
      "decision": "Debugging workflow includes code instrumentation with cleanup",
      "rationale": "Agent observes existing logs first, then surgically adds console.logs when needed for deeper visibility. All temporary instrumentation is removed at the end so codebase returns to clean state.",

    {
      "decision": "Use browser_navigate to same URL for refresh (not just hot reload)",
      "rationale": "Even with hot reload, explicit navigation clears console logs and ensures truly fresh page state. Gives clean slate for each observation cycle.",
      "made_at": "2026-01-06T00:03:00Z"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Setup phase: observe current URL first, then confirm with user",
      "rationale": "Agent takes browser_snapshot to see current page, confirms with user if that's the right place. User can confirm or redirect. Collaborative approach - not fully autonomous guessing, not fully manual.",
      "made_at": "2026-01-06T00:04:00Z"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Collaborative workflow with user confirmations, not fully autonomous",
      "rationale": "Agent handles mechanical tedium (screenshots, logs, instrumentation, refreshes). User stays in loop for judgment calls: confirming URL, approving fixes, verifying resolution. Reduces friction without removing human oversight.",
      "made_at": "2026-01-06T00:05:00Z"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Debug log convention: single console.log with [DEBUG-AGENT] marker, context, and data",
      "rationale": "Browser console groups arguments from one console.log() as single expandable entry. Format: console.log('[DEBUG-AGENT]', '[Context.location]', { data }). Cleanup via grep for marker, git diff as fallback.",
      "made_at": "2026-01-06T00:06:00Z"
    },
    {
      "decision": "General-purpose debugging workflow, not category-specific",
      "rationale": "No consistent pain points yet that warrant specialization. Build foundation first, iterate and specialize later based on real usage patterns.",

    },
    {
      "decision": "Log placement: agent judgment with light guidance on common patterns",
      "rationale": "Trust agent to decide contextually. Include common patterns (component boundaries, async ops, data transforms, event handlers, state updates) as reference, not prescription.",

    },
    {
      "decision": "Design critique is analysis-focused, not implementation",
      "rationale": "Critique workflow gathers info, produces report, supports iterative refinement. Output feeds into plan mode for actual implementation. Keeps critique scope clean.",

    {
      "decision": "Context gathering: infer first, then confirm with user (required)",
      "rationale": "Agent infers app/page purpose from visual + code, presents understanding for user confirmation. Must have confirmed context before critique proceeds. Ensures clear shared understanding.",

    {
      "decision": "Critique output saved to agents/design-sessions/{id}/",
